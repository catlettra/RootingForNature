# RootingForNature
Depressing website made with Bootstrap for a university project, the goal was to imagine some products that would be useful in protecting life on earth and we thought about tree-planting drones and pollinating drones in order to support bees' work. We opted for a very basic and simple look also because we are bad at this. This website is sad.
